## 🧠 Domain Knowledge

Bank loans are vital financial products for both individuals and businesses. Understanding loan data helps institutions manage risk, improve approval accuracy, and optimize profitability.

**Key stages of the loan lifecycle:**
- Application submission (online or paper)
- Identity, income, credit, and employment verification
- DTI (Debt-to-Income) assessment
- Collateral evaluation (if applicable)
- Risk-based loan decisioning
- Agreement, disbursement, and repayment
- Ongoing monitoring & compliance

**Why banks analyze loan data:**
- Risk assessment & fraud detection
- Creditworthiness scoring
- Regulatory compliance (e.g. KYC, HMDA)
- Loan portfolio optimization
- Customer segmentation & product targeting
- Profitability forecasting
