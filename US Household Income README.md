üè† US Household Income Analysis (MySQL Project)
üìä Project Objective:
To clean, transform, and explore a U.S. household income dataset (32,000+ records) using SQL to identify patterns in income distribution across states, city types, and geographic features ‚Äî with real-world implications for economic strategy, equity initiatives, and resource allocation.

üîß Data Cleaning & Standardization
Performed extensive preprocessing and validation to ensure high data integrity:

Renamed BOM-corrupted columns (e.g., √Ø¬ª¬øid ‚Üí id)

Removed duplicate rows using ROW_NUMBER() and DELETE

Corrected typos in State_Name, Type, and Place fields ('georia' ‚Üí 'Georgia', 'CPD' ‚Üí 'CDP')

Standardized text values and null entries (e.g., blank Place fields filled based on logic)

Validated geographic values:

Flagged and filtered rows where ALand or AWater was 0, null, or suspiciously low

Ensured data types were consistent and analysis-ready

üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Insights
States with Most Land: Texas, California, Missouri

States with Most Water: Michigan, Texas, Florida

Top Water-to-Land Ratio: Hawaii (0.6595), Delaware (0.3323), Alaska (0.2919)

Implication: Land/water ratios can impact infrastructure costs, housing potential, and flood zone risk.

üí∞ Income Distribution by State
Top Median Incomes: NJ, WY, AK, CT, MA (>$119K)

Lowest Median Incomes: PR, AR, MS, LA, OK (<$65K)

Highest Income Gaps (Mean > Median): Indicates skew and potential inequality.

üèôÔ∏è City-Level Income Analysis
Top 5 cities by mean income include:

Delta Junction (AK), Short Hills (NJ), Chevy Chase (MD), Darien (CT), Pelham (NY)

Most are suburban elite zones with concentrated wealth.

üß± Place Type (Structural) Insights
Filtered and ranked types with 100+ entries:

Type	  Median Income	    Count
CDP	     $116,231.9	      964
Track	   $86,925.3	      28,939
Borough	 $73,384.0	      129
Village	 $72,316.7	      388
City	   $64,850.4	      1,055
Town	   $63,846.6	      473

CDPs and Boroughs consistently rank highest in median income, while Communities and Urban areas showed the lowest ‚Äî suggesting resource access gaps and classification-driven income stratification.

üíº Business Recommendations

‚úÖ 1. Targeted Infrastructure & Development
Prioritize water-dense states (Hawaii, Michigan) for flood infrastructure, marine transportation investment, or tourism development.

Allocate economic development funds to underperforming states (e.g., Mississippi, Arkansas) with low median and mean incomes.

‚úÖ 2. Policy-Making & Social Equity
Use mean-median income gaps as proxies for inequality; states with high discrepancies may benefit from:

Income redistribution programs

Affordable housing expansion

Localized tax credits or wage subsidies

‚úÖ 3. Market Strategy & Real Estate
Invest or market high-end financial, luxury, or housing services in CDPs, Boroughs, and elite cities (e.g., Darien, Short Hills, Agoura Hills).

In contrast, urban or community-designated regions may represent underserved markets for low-cost housing, public services, or local entrepreneurship incentives.

‚úÖ 4. Federal & State Resource Allocation
States/Territories like Puerto Rico, West Virginia, and Alabama show persistent low-income performance. Agencies could use this data to:

Reallocate grants

Fund community colleges or retraining programs

Improve digital access and broadband in low-income tracts
